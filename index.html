			<h1>Last Christmas</h1>
			<h3>Wham!</h3>
			<p>Last Christmas I gave you my heart<br>But the very next day<br>You gave it away<br>This year<br>To save me from tears<br>I'll give it to someone special</p>
			<p>Once bitten and twice shy<br>I keep my distance<br>But you still catch my eye<br>Tell me baby<br>Do you recognize me?<br>Well It's been a year<br>It doesn't surprise me</p> 
			<p>I wrapped it up and sent it<br>With a note saying "I love you"<br>I meant it<br>Now I know what a fool I've been<br>But if you kissed me now I know you'd fool me again</p>
