			<h1>Last Christmas</h1>
			<h3>Wham!</h3>
			<p>Last Christmas I gave you my heart<br>But the very next day<br>You gave it away<br>This year<br>To save me from tears<br>I'll give it to someone special</p>
			<p>Once bitten and twice shy<br>I keep my distance<br>But you still catch my eye<br>Tell me baby<br>Do you recognize me?<br>Well It's been a year<br>It doesn't surprise me</p> 
			<p>A crowded room<br>Friends with tired eyes<br>I'm hiding from you<br>And your soul of ice<br>My God I thought you were<br>Someone to rely on<br>Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on</p>
